    "I'm Jughurta Menzou, a junior software engineer with a passion for building and creating. Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how things workâ€”whether it was assembling LEGOÂ® sets or solving complex puzzles. That same curiosity led me into the world of software development, where I now turn ideas into functional and impactful digital solutions. I recently graduated with a B.A.Sc. in Software Engineering from the University of Ottawa. I've gained over a year of hands-on experience working as a full-stack developer at two startups. Through these experiences, I honed my skills in React.js, Node.js, Laravel, Flutter, and Spring Boot. I've also gained expertise in database management, cloud computing, and DevOps tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges. I thrive on pushing boundaries and improving my craft. My goal? To reach my full potential as a software engineer while helping companies build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications. Feel free to check out my work on GitHub, connect with me on LinkedIn, or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate! ðŸš€"
